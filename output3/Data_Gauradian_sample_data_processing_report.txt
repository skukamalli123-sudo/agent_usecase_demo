Detailed Analysis:
File: Data_Gauradian_sample_data.txt
- Missing values: 8 (all imputed with median, defaults, or safe nulls)
- Type mismatches: 12 (corrected to integer, boolean, or normalized formats)
- Out-of-range values: 6 (negative or invalid replaced with median or safe values)
- Duplicates: 9 (removed via exact, partial, and normalized matching)
- Validation: All fields passed, 100% compliance

Cleaned Output: Data_Gauradian_sample_data_cleaned.csv
Corrections Manifest: Data_Gauradian_sample_data_corrections.csv

Audit Log:
- All corrections, duplicate removals, and normalization steps are logged in the corrections manifest with timestamps and reasons.
- Every change is traceable and deterministic per the correction manifest.
- No unresolved errors remain; all validation rules enforced.

Troubleshooting Guide:
- Git authentication failed: Check token permissions in Github_info.txt
- Schema mismatch: Review input file for header/column consistency
- Output not found: Ensure output3 directory exists and branch is correct
- Correction manifest missing: Re-run pipeline with all mandatory outputs enabled

Recommendations:
- Add explicit schema definitions to input files for more robust validation
- Use consistent date and boolean formats in source data
- Implement stricter uniqueness constraints on key fields (e.g., id, email)
- Consider automated email/phone normalization libraries for improved accuracy
- Enable repository webhooks for real-time data validation
